            <h3>How it Started</h3>
            <p>
                We date back to the 1950's when JCR Licklider a professor at MIT had a vision that the computer would allow for easier communication and become a useful tool that would people would utilize to share information. By 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik, leaving the United States in a vulnerable position. Once this occurred they felt a huge push to utilize computers to help with their defense strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the military was trying to find way to communicate circuit switching was introduced. It gave a straight connect for the military to communicate, the only downfall being that it could be easily destroyed and connection could be a total lose. Paul Baran introduced "Fishnet Network," which created made sure that messages were still being communicated through a network even if half of the signal got lost. This idea broke up messages into Packets and would find any available paths and later come back together to deliver the full message.

            <h3>ARPA</h3>
            <p>
                In the late 1950's the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), was in charge of the space program which included anything to do with computer science. In the beginning stages, computer science was kept incubated until it was put into the proper hands. Bob Taylor, was the pioneer of ARPA created the new idea of Time Sharing. This allowed for a person to sit at a terminal and type questions and programs as answers would appear back in seconds. A terminal allowed for on common network to talk to all systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since these terminals could not speak to each other, Larry Roberts built the first experimental connection between two computers. He found that you are able to distribute the network to more computers by building identical mini computers. As we began approaching the 1970's they realized that this idea could evolve into the ARPANET, which was going to be millions of mini computers to help connect networks. To build such a system there was a need for smart out-of-the-box thinkers to participate in what we would later know as the Internet.
