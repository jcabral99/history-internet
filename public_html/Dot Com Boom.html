            <h3>The Start</h3>
            <p>
                The Internet was growing at an unexpected rate. Web browsers had created a whole new world that people did not even know they needed. As advertising on the internet became the new hit, people purchasing items through the web did as well. eBay and Amazon were first of many .Com sites that allowed for e-commerce to take its toll on the American people. Amazon began by selling books, while eBay became the first online auction site. The two companies were thriving within their markets, so they took the opportunity to open Initial Public Offerings (IPO).
            </p>
            <p>
                The markets were booming. The companies were growing faster than ever and people began seeing that creating a public company would create a large revenue stream. All anyone had to do was create a name and add ".com" and no matter what it took, have something to sell.

            <h3>Crashing</h3>
            <p>
                As more and more IPO became available it gave insight to online stock trading. Brokers no longer had to be on Wall Street buying and trading stocks, but now anyone could trade stock from the comfort of their own home. CNBC began reporting the good and bad or the market and day traders began using it to help them make their decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 90's were reaching an end and e-commerce was continuing to grow. People were making websites left and right and venture capitalists were investing as much as they could. They felt that eventually one of them would take off and have the growth that Amazon and eBay had. As day trading became the new normal Wall Street began to fear their jobs. With the internet taking over the stock market quickly it raised lots of suspicion within the government. April 12, 2000 the great e-commerce bubble made its boom. It was the greatest collapse of the economic market and the NASDAQ lost 2/3 of its value. Many people were being arrested and charged with fraud within the stock market.

            <h3>Surviving</h3>
            <p>
                The ball dropped, and it was make a break for a lot of the .Com companies. The corrupt commerce was being weeded out slowly and ensure that all website were legit. Amazon and eBay stayed strong throughout the boom and are still growing today. The smaller .com websites wanted to thrive the same way Amazon and eBay did, they felt empowered by the way they touched so many individuals. The internet went from being the most unknown space to touched almost every person in the world. It was created to connect individuals and connect them to the information they needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the 1950's through the early 2000's, web changed the world, but the golden age of the internet is yet to come and will continue to evolve before our eyes.
