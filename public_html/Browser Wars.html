            <h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
            <p>
                As we entered a new era with the start of the Internet, the development needed to continue. In 1992, the World Wide Web only had 50 pages on the internet that were accessible. This opened the doors to tech pioneers to use their skills and make the web a user-friendly space. The first user browser was created by Marc Andreesson, naming it Mosaic. It was graphically rich and made it easier for people to access content through the web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                People began seeing what exactly a web browser was able to do and thought they could do it better. It was a race to the Internet. To get your browser up and running and have more bells and whistles then the last one. By 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo came out with the first search engine, calling it "Yahoo." Yahoo changed the world of search engines as they began adding advertising and pop ads within the browser. The take-off of this was tremendous.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so it began...The Browser War.

            <h3>The Competition</h3>
            <p>
                It did not matter who you were or what you did, you wanted a piece of the Internet. Summer of 1994, Silicon Valley, Jim Clarke and Marc Andreesson began NetScape system. This would be known as the first graphical web browser that would change commerce forever. As NetScape began to gain traction, the famous Microsoft felt that the browser world was too good of an opportunity to miss out on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft had already created a name for themselves since most PC's carried Microsoft Windows. When they saw what a web browser had the power to do they felt they needed to be part of that as well. The infamous meet up happened between NetScape and Microsoft where a deal was going to be made, but ultimately ended in the biggest battle. NetScape felt that they had control of the browser world and would not let Microsoft come in and take over.
            </p>
            <p>
                The competition between these two companies began. Microsoft came out with their own browser called Internet Explorer. Microsoft made it a point to ensure that all PCs would have their web browser automatically bundled into the windows operating system. While NetScape had changed the browser world, they charged people to download it and Microsoft found a way to monopolize the situation.

            <h3>The Result</h3>
            <p>
                By 1997, the Browser War was coming to an end. NetScape was struggling to survive and was eventually acquired by AOL. While Microsoft was taking over browser the US government went after their founder, Bill Gates. In 1998, they were accused of using their window monopoly to put NetScape under.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as these two companies fixated so much on each other, many others were working on their own browser ideas. September 1998, Larry Paige and Sergey Brim launched Google. Their search engine was based around how much people were going to one specific search. Google cared about the "search" aspect and separated the advertisements from a person's organic search. Google became the fastest growing company, while Yahoo and Microsoft would continue to try and compete against them.
