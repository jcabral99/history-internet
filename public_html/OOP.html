            <h3>How it Started</h3>
            <p>
                We date back to the 1950's when JCR Licklider a professor at MIT had a vision that the computer would allow for easier communication and become a useful tool that would people would utilize to share information. By 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik, leaving the United States in a vulnerable position. Once this occurred they felt a huge push to utilize computers to help with their defense strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the military was trying to find way to communicate circuit switching was introduced. It gave a straight connect for the military to communicate, the only downfall being that it could be easily destroyed and connection could be a total lose. Paul Baran introduced "Fishnet Network," which created made sure that messages were still being communicated through a network even if half of the signal got lost. This idea broke up messages into Packets and would find any available paths and later come back together to deliver the full message.

            <h3>ARPA</h3>
            <p>
                In the late 1950's the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), was in charge of the space program which included anything to do with computer science. In the beginning stages, computer science was kept incubated until it was put into the proper hands. Bob Taylor, was the pioneer of ARPA created the new idea of Time Sharing. This allowed for a person to sit at a terminal and type questions and programs as answers would appear back in seconds. A terminal allowed for on common network to talk to all systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since these terminals could not speak to each other, Larry Roberts built the first experimental connection between two computers. He found that you are able to distribute the network to more computers by building identical mini computers. As we began approaching the 1970's they realized that this idea could evolve into the ARPANET, which was going to be millions of mini computers to help connect networks. To build such a system there was a need for smart out-of-the-box thinkers to participate in what we would later know as the Internet.

            <h3>The Internet</h3>
            <p>
                On June 9th 1992 Congress passed a bill taking the internet out of the exclusive hands of government and into the public. The following November President Bush signed it into law. A huge surge of commercial energy, competition and progress came from the use of Internet.  A physicist named Tim Berners-lee at the CERN Research Institute in Switzerland created an easier way to access all the information in one place. He developed the software to more easily follow threads of knowledge within the information stored throughout the internet. He named his invention the World Wide Web. It started growing on itself that went from just Tim in his little computer to a worldwide phenomenon carrying billions going on trillions of dollars of Commerce. The World Wide Web made it easier to follow threads of information.
